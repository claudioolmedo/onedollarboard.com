# About the One Dollar Board

The One Dollar Board is more than a microcontroller board.

It is an engineering project built through ordinary work — soldering, coding, testing, documenting, refining, and sharing. For those behind it, this work has a spiritual dimension. It is an intentional effort to lower barriers, awaken talent, and give access to real engineering tools to anyone, anywhere.

This project is inspired by a simple idea: greatness is built in the ordinary. Daily work matters. Engineering can be service. Building can be meaningful.

Whatever your worldview — spiritual, secular, or in between — if you share the mission of awakening talent, you belong here.

## The Core Mission

**To awaken talent around the world.**

Talent is not distributed by geography, income, race, language, or status. Call it providence, chance, or simply the way things are — talent emerges everywhere.

Opportunity often does not.

The One Dollar Board exists to close that gap.

When a pencil is inexpensive, no one questions access — people simply buy it and create.  
The One Dollar Board aims to make electronics feel the same way.

Not a luxury kit.  
Not a premium gadget.  
Not a locked ecosystem.

Just a simple, accessible, powerful board that makes invention possible.

---

## What It Is

The One Dollar Board is:

- A minimal RISC‑V development board
- Designed for extremely low-cost manufacturing
- WebHID compatible
- Friendly to school environments
- Designed to be fabricated anywhere in the world

It is intentionally simple.

Single-sided assembly.  
Minimal BOM.  
No unnecessary components.  
No marketing excess.  

Only what is necessary to learn, experiment, and invent.

---

## Open Source with Responsibility

Anyone can download the files.  
Anyone can manufacture it.  
Anyone can improve it.

But openness without responsibility becomes noise.

The One Dollar Board should always represent:

- Accessibility
- Integrity
- Simplicity
- Education first
- Long-term thinking
- Respect for the mission

This is not just open hardware. It is open hardware with purpose.

---

## Why “One Dollar”?

The name is a declaration of intent.

It represents:

- Removing psychological barriers to entry
- Making hardware feel as accessible as free software
- Challenging the assumption that powerful tools must be expensive
- Encouraging experimentation without fear

Even if costs fluctuate, the intention does not.

The mission is radical accessibility.

## Designed in Austin. Meant for the World.

Designed in Austin, Texas — a city of builders, engineers, and makers.

But intended for:

- A child in Brazil  
- A student in India  
- A teacher in Africa  
- A hacker in Eastern Europe  
- A classroom in rural America  

Geography should not determine who becomes an engineer.

Access should not depend on privilege.

---

## More Than a Board

The One Dollar Board is a foundation.

It enables:

- ROBOX™ educational robotics
- A modular RJ45 plug ecosystem
- Web-based compilation tools
- Distributed manufacturing
- Micro-factories
- A new generation of inventors

It is not the end product.

It is a seed.

---

## The Deeper Intention

This project is also personal.

It has been built over more than a decade of persistence, iteration, mistakes, redesigns, and learning.

It is built with:

- Conviction
- Long-term commitment
- Work done in difficult seasons
- The belief that technology should serve humanity
- The conviction that talent deserves opportunity

For the team behind it, engineering has been purposeful work — sometimes prayer, sometimes simply dedication. Innovation, in any case, can be service.

---

## Continuing the Mission

This project continues because the mission is not finished.

It exists to keep building, improving, documenting, manufacturing, and sharing — so that more talents and inventors can be awakened around the world.

Every revision matters.  
Every board produced matters.  
Every classroom reached matters.

The goal is not simply to launch a product.

The goal is to sustain a movement that helps people discover their capacity to invent.

---

## For the Community

If you are here, you are part of this.

Whether you:

- Manufacture boards  
- Teach with them  
- Write firmware  
- Improve documentation  
- Share the idea  
- Or simply experiment  

You are helping awaken talent.

---

## The Future

This project aims to build something foundational:

A simple, accessible, durable tool that can exist for decades.

A board that:

- Works in schools  
- Works in low-resource environments  
- Works directly with web tools  
- Works without unnecessary friction  

A board that makes engineering feel possible.

---

## Final Words

If you believe talent deserves opportunity,  
if you believe engineering should be accessible,  
if you believe work can be meaningful,

then welcome.

Let's awaken talent around the world.

# About the One Dollar Board

The One Dollar Board is a minimal, open‑source RISC‑V development board designed for extremely low‑cost manufacturing and global accessibility.

It was built through practical engineering work — soldering, coding, testing, documenting, refining, and sharing — with a clear objective: lower the barrier to entry for hardware development.

The goal is simple:

Make real engineering tools accessible to anyone, anywhere.

---

## The Core Mission

**To awaken talent around the world by removing barriers to entry.**

Talent exists everywhere.

Access does not.

The One Dollar Board exists to narrow that gap by making hardware:

- Affordable  
- Manufacturable  
- Understandable  
- Web‑compatible  
- Open  

When a tool is inexpensive and easy to access, experimentation becomes natural.

The board aims to make electronics feel as accessible as a pencil — simple, available, and ready to use.

---

## What It Is

The One Dollar Board is:

- A minimal RISC‑V (CH32V003) development board  
- Designed for 2‑layer PCB manufacturing  
- Single‑side SMD assembly  
- 0603 passives  
- WebHID compatible  
- Fully open‑source (Gerbers, BOM, Pick & Place available)  
- Designed to be fabricated anywhere in the world  

It is intentionally simple.

No unnecessary components.  
No locked ecosystem.  
No proprietary barriers.  

Only what is necessary to learn, experiment, and build.

---

## Manufacturing Philosophy

The board was designed with manufacturing in mind from the start:

- Standard JLCPCB‑friendly footprints  
- Minimal BOM  
- Cost‑optimized layout  
- Clear silkscreen labeling  
- Easy SMT assembly  

Anyone can download the files and fabricate the board using common PCB assembly services.

Open hardware only matters if it is actually buildable.

---

## Why “One Dollar”?

The name represents intent, not a fixed price.

It reflects:

- Radical cost awareness  
- Psychological accessibility  
- Encouragement to experiment  
- The belief that powerful tools do not need to be expensive  

Even if market prices fluctuate, the mission remains the same:

Lower the barrier.

---

## Looking Forward

The long‑term objective is to create:

- A durable, maintainable hardware platform  
- A board compatible with web‑based tooling  
- A system that works in schools and independent environments  
- A foundation for AI‑assisted hardware development  

The board is not the end product.

It is infrastructure.
